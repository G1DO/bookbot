# üìö BookBot  

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project! üöÄ  

It analyzes books (plain text files) and prints a report of:  
- Total word count  
- Character frequency (sorted from most common to least)  

---

## ‚ö° Features  
- Reads any `.txt` book file  
- Counts total words  
- Counts each character frequency (case-insensitive)  
- Outputs a clean statistical report in the terminal  
- Works with multiple books (Frankenstein, Moby Dick, Pride and Prejudice, etc.)
